Description: This package is meant to make navigating and setting the working directory, as well as extracting to and from
    different directories a bit easier. While users with R Studio can easily set the working directory with the GUI, users
    who only have a CLI may benefit from this package. Setting the working directory or finding the directory you want can
    be a bit tedious without a GUI, so this makes it a bit simpler. For extracting files, this makes it easier for both
    users who use either a GUI or a CLI. Right now this only extracts two main file types which are .zip and .gz files, so
    this should only be used by windows users. Neither Mac or Linux have been tested with this.
